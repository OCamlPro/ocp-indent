type foo = int                          (* just in case *)



(* yminsky: These two shouldn't be indented differently, but are. *)

type z =
  [ `Bar of foo
  (* a comment [expected to apply to `Foo as below] *)
  | `Foo ]

type z =
  [ `Bar
  (* a comment *)
  | `Foo ]



(* pszilagyi: On second thought, I kind of like this way of thinking about this
   indentation, even though it is kind of parasyntactic: *)

type z =
  (* Applies to "[" or `Bar. *)
  [ `Bar of foo
  (* Applies to "|" or `Foo.  Indented too much. *)
  | `Foo ]

type z =
  (* Applies to "[" or `Bar. *)
  [ `Bar
  (* Applies to "|" or `Foo. *)
  | `Foo ]

(* The way we write code, that will line up more nicely. *)



let _ =                                 (* yminsky *)
  (foo
     (* This is indented too far to the left *)
     (bar))

(* pszilagyi: It looks to me like we generally want the comment to apply to the
   following line in most circumstances, including this one.  The default indent
   for an empty line after a function application that isn't terminated with a
   ";" or something would probably also be in a bit, in anticipation of an
   argument, although I don't think that's crucial. *)
